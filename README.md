Running the program on Windows.
  Since the software is not certified yet, it will be flagged by Windows Defender Smartscreen, 
  saying that it "prevented an unrecognized app from starting".
  
  First solution:
    When the screen pops up, click more info and then run anyway.
    
  Second solution:
    If the option above is not available.
    1. Right click on the program
    2. Click properties
    3. Check the "Unblock" box.
    4. Click "OK"
    5. You may now run the application as usual by double clicking on its icon.
